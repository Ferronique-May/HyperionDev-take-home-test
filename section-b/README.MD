# Section B - Projects

This a project I did in the grad program - [Rent a Partner](https://github.com/Ferronique-May-bbd/rent-a-partner)

We were a team of 6 if I remember correctly, most of which were just starting their tech career. 

A few things to note in the DBContext file in the backend folder those credentials won't work, the database has been deleted.

In order for the forms to work you're going to need to replace those details with your local mysql connection details. The scripts for the DB is in the doc folder.

The project isn't very well documented either. 

So to start it up you're going to need to install all the packages in the backend and frontend folders then execute the server files in the respective folders in different terminals as it needs to run simultaneously.
These are the commands you should run in both folders:
``````
npm i
node server.js
``````
Not everything works perfectly, we had very limited time to do this. 

It's my favourite project, because I had a really fun time working with my teammates. I still think we did a pretty decent job with the time limit we had. 

The project spec was to build a website that used no frontend frameworks. There also restrictions on what we could and could not use on the backend.
